# What is the difference between longest common subsstring and longest common subsequence?


The difference between a longest common substring and a longest common subsequence is the criterion of contiguity. The symbols that make up a longest common substring must appear in both strings as a contiguous string. The symbols that make up a longest common subsequence need only appear in the same order in each string; there may be intervening symbols in between. Given the strings "hippopotamus" and "rhinoceros", the longest common substring is "hi", while the longest common subsequence is "hioos".
